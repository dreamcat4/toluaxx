<h2>Building with Microsoft Compiler</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Minimum requirements</h3>
<p>
The following tools are required :
<ul>
	<li> Microsoft C/C++ Compiler v 14.00.50727.42 or newer (from Microsoft Visual Studio 8. Please reply about MSVS 7 compliance)</li>
	<li> GNU make utility ( see chapter GNU make installation instructions )</li>
</ul>
In addition you have to download and build <a href = "http://www.lua.org/">lua</a>.
<hr>
<h3>GNU make installation instructions</h3>
<p>
GNU make is a very powerful utility for automating project building routines. You can download
windows version at <a href = "http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml">mingw download page</a>.
<p>
We'll suggest that you are installing make to the C:\GNUtools directory. After installation
you have to rename the make binary from something like mingw32-make.exe to make.exe (just for your convenience), then 
set your PATH environment variable to correspond to your GNU make installation directory. 
For our directory (C:\GNUtools) you can do it like this :
<ul>
	<li> run shell : start - run - type in 'cmd' (without quotes)</li>
	<li> type in 'set PATH=C:\GNUtools;%PATH%' (without quotes)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now type make in your shell. You will receive a message like this one bellow
<p>
make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
<p>
If you can see this message, then your GNU make is installed correctly. Otherwise make sure that you
provided correct PATH to your make executable
<hr>
<h3>Building toluaxx</h3>
<p>
We suggest that you have already unpacked the sources to some directory (e.g. C:\toluaxx).
Run your shell and change directory to C:\toluaxx.
Copy your lua headers to include/lua5.1 directory and lua5.1.lib to lib directory. 
If your MS Visual Studio installation path differs from C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8 then 
open config.win32-msvs.local with your favourite text editor uncomment VSPATH variable (remove '#') and
change this string in compliance with your MS Visual Studio installation path.
<p>
Run make in your shell. If you received something like this at the end of the build process
<p><br>
Build bin complete....
<br>
Build include complete....
<br>
Build all complete....
<p>
<br>then everything is OK, check bin and lib directories to make sure that build was successful

<h4>Known troubles :</h1>
<p><ul>
<li>It is highly recommended to disable unicode support while compilling toluaxx and lua with msvc 8 compiler</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building with GCC (MINGW)<h2>
<hr>
<h3>Minimum requirements</h3>
<p>
The following tools are required :
<ul>
	<li> Basic MINGW installation including GCC, G++, make, binutils, Windows API, MinGW Runtime</li>
</ul>
<p>All these packages and installation instructions you can find at <a href = "http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml">mingw download page</a>

<hr>
<h3>Building toluaxx</h3>
<p>Building toluaxx is rather easy with mingw:<br>
Specify correct path to your lua5.1/src directory in config.win32-mingw.local by setting LUA.I and LUA.L variables. Don't foget to uncomment these variables 
Run your shell, navigate to the toluaxx directory and run make
