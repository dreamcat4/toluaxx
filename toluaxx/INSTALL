This version of toluaxx uses GNU Make to compile (http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html).
(windows version make.exe can be find http://mingw.org/download.shtml)


* Building

  1. Specify options into the `config` file for your platform to suit your
     environment, if at all necessary.
     
     Check config file before: opt/$(PLATFORM)-$(COMPILER)
     
     PLATFORM=your OS platform
     COMPILER=your compiler
     
     For example, opt/linux_gcc:
     
     PLATFORM=linux
     COMPILER=gcc
     
     
  2. Then, type 'make'.
     
     You may specify `platform` and `compiler` variables with make, as example:
     
     $ make all platform=linux compiler=gcc
     

* Installation

     For installation you can type `make install`. Check variable `PREFIX` in `config` before.
  
     You also may specify `prefix` variables with make, as example:
     
     $ make install prefix=/usr


* Uninstallation

    For installation you can type `make uninstall`.

    If you use `prefix` when install, you can also uninstall with this prefix.
    

* What you get

  If "make" succeeds, you get:
	* an executable to generate binding code in ./bin;
	* the C library to be linked in your application in ./lib;
	* the include file needed to compile your application in ./include.
  These are the only directories you need for development, besides Lua.

  You can use 'make install' to install the files, see the 'prefix' option.
